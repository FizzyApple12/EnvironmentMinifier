## What is this?

EnvironmentMinifier is a barebones, chroma-style way to remove things from the stock game environments. (Also shouldn't break chroma)

<br/>

## How can I customize it?

There is no in-game UI, only a config file. The ``EnvironmentRemoval`` property inside of the config allows you to define which objects to remove from the scene. You can read up on chroma if you want to learn more. (To use the stock config, simply delete the config file)

<br/>

## What libraries or other plugins does it need?

 * BSIPA
 * SiraUtil
 * FizzyUtils

<br/>

## Great! How do I get it?

You can either download a released version from the releases tab or build it yourself.

Here are the steps to build the Project:

1. Link all of the DLLs from the Beat Saber directory

2. Build the project

3. Copy ``EnvironmentMinifier.dll`` to the ``Plugins`` folder

4. That's it! You're done!
